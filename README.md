For the advanced part, code is all in the main folder. Python files:
* `Game.py` - sets up the environment, and has methods to aid the snake's perception of it
* `Agent.py` - controls the behaviour of the sname
* `Model.py` - the neural nets used by the agent (DQN or Dueling)
* `ExperienceReplayBuffer.py` - class to control the replay buffer
* `helper.py` - visualisation functions and more importantly the training loop

Analysis is presented in the notebooks. Examiners can ignore everything except the snappily named `Q-Learning_Comparisons-v2.ipynb`. This has all training for all models, all evaluation for all models/approaches and the best explanations. Everything else can by ignored.
